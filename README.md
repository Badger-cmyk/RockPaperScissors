## Description

A game of rock, paper scissors played against the computer.

* Game stops when either player reaches five points, after which the buttons to play are disabled.
* To play again, refresh the page.

## What I Learned
* Manipulating the DOM

* The importance of scopes(local and global).

* Using event delegation to capture an event as it bubbles in a parent element and assign an event listener to that parent element rather than assigning multiple event listeners to elements.

* Refactoring of written code(writing the code in a less redundant and verbose manner if possible).

* Looping with the forEach() method.

## Usage
* Clone the repository.

* Run the game on your live server(localhost).
